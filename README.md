curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renancavalcantercb/healthcheck-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/renancavalcantercb/healthcheck-cli.git
cd healthcheck-cli

# Build the project
make build

# Install (optional)
make install
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/renancavalcantercb/healthcheck-cli.git
cd healthcheck-cli

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build and install
go build -o healthcheck cmd/healthcheck/main.go
sudo mv healthcheck /usr/local/bin/
```

Note: The `go install` command is not currently supported as the project needs to be built with CGO enabled for SQLite support.

## Quick Start

1. Generate an example configuration:
```bash
healthcheck config example config.yml
```

2. Edit the configuration file to add your endpoints:
```yaml
checks:
  - name: "API Health"
    type: "http"
    url: "https://api.example.com/health"
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    expected:
      status: 200
      body_contains: "healthy"
```

3. Start monitoring:
```bash
healthcheck monitor config.yml
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
global:
  max_workers: 10        # Maximum number of concurrent checks
  default_timeout: 10s
  default_interval: 30s
  storage_path: "./healthcheck.db"
  log_level: "info"

checks:
  - name: "API Health"
    type: "http"
    url: "https://api.example.com/health"
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    method: "GET"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
    expected:
      status: 200
      body_contains: "healthy"
      response_time_max: 2s
```

### Email Notifications

```yaml
notifications:
  email:
    enabled: true
    smtp_host: "smtp.gmail.com"
    smtp_port: 587
    username: "your-email@gmail.com"
    password: "${EMAIL_PASSWORD}"  # Use app password for Gmail
    from: "your-email@gmail.com"
    to: ["recipient@example.com"]
    subject: "üö® HealthCheck Alert: {{.Name}}"
    tls: true
```

### Discord Notifications

```yaml
notifications:
  discord:
    enabled: true
    webhook_url: "${DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL}"
    username: "HealthCheck Bot"
    avatar_url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renancavalcantercb/healthcheck-cli/main/assets/logo.png"
```

### Notification Rules

```yaml
notifications:
  global_rules:
    on_success: true
    on_failure: true
    on_recovery: true
    on_slow_response: true
    cooldown: 5m
    max_alerts: 10
    escalation_delay: 15m
```

### Performance Optimization

The tool uses a worker pool to execute health checks in parallel, which significantly improves performance when monitoring multiple endpoints. You can configure the number of concurrent workers in the global settings:

```yaml
global:
  max_workers: 10  # Adjust based on your system's capabilities
```

Key benefits of parallel execution:
- Faster overall execution time
- Better resource utilization
- Configurable concurrency level
- Automatic load balancing
- Graceful error handling

## Usage

### Monitor Endpoints

```bash
# Monitor with configuration file
healthcheck monitor config.yml

# Run in daemon mode
healthcheck monitor config.yml --daemon

# Quick check single endpoint
healthcheck quick https://api.example.com/health

# Test endpoint immediately
healthcheck test https://api.example.com/health
```

### View Status

```bash
# Show status dashboard
healthcheck status

# Interactive dashboard
healthcheck status --watch

# With specific config
healthcheck status --config config.yml
```
