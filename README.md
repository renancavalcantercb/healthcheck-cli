```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/renancavalcantercb/healthcheck-cli.git
cd healthcheck-cli

# Build the project
make build

# Install (optional)
make install
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/renancavalcantercb/healthcheck-cli.git
cd healthcheck-cli

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build and install
go build -o healthcheck cmd/healthcheck/main.go

## Quick Start

1. Generate an example configuration:
```bash
healthcheck config example config.yml
```

2. Edit the configuration file to add your endpoints:
```yaml
checks:
  - name: "API Health"
    type: "http"
    url: "https://api.example.com/health"
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    expected:
      status: 200
      body_contains: "healthy"
  
  - name: "SSL Certificate Check"
    type: "ssl"
    url: "https://api.example.com"
    interval: 24h
    timeout: 10s
    expected:
      cert_expiry_days: 30
      cert_valid_domains: ["api.example.com"]
```

3. Start monitoring:
```bash
healthcheck monitor config.yml
```

## Check Types

HealthCheck CLI supports three types of monitoring:

### 1. HTTP/HTTPS Checks (`type: http`)
Monitor web endpoints, APIs, and web services:
- **Status code validation** (200, 404, etc.)
- **Response body content** (contains/not contains text)
- **Response time monitoring**
- **Custom headers and request body**
- **Content-Type validation**
- **Minimum body size checks**

### 2. TCP Port Checks (`type: tcp`)
Monitor TCP services and port connectivity:
- **Port connectivity testing**
- **Connection time monitoring**
- **Network service availability**

### 3. SSL Certificate Checks (`type: ssl`)
Monitor SSL/TLS certificate health:
- **Certificate expiration monitoring**
- **Domain validation (CN + SAN)**
- **SSL handshake performance**
- **Certificate chain validation**
- **Issuer and subject information**

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
global:
  max_workers: 10        # Maximum number of concurrent checks
  default_timeout: 10s
  default_interval: 30s
  storage_path: "./healthcheck.db"
  log_level: "info"

checks:
  - name: "API Health"
    type: "http"
    url: "https://api.example.com/health"
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    method: "GET"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
    expected:
      status: 200
      body_contains: "healthy"
      response_time_max: 2s

  - name: "Database TCP Check"
    type: "tcp"
    url: "db.example.com:5432"
    interval: 60s
    timeout: 5s
    expected:
      response_time_max: 500ms

  - name: "SSL Certificate Monitor"
    type: "ssl"
    url: "https://api.example.com"
    interval: 24h
    timeout: 10s
    expected:
      cert_expiry_days: 30      # Alert if expires within 30 days
      cert_valid_domains: ["api.example.com", "www.api.example.com"]
      response_time_max: 5s
```

### Email Notifications

```yaml
notifications:
  email:
    enabled: true
    smtp_host: "smtp.gmail.com"
    smtp_port: 587
    username: "your-email@gmail.com"
    password: "${EMAIL_PASSWORD}"  # Use app password for Gmail
    from: "your-email@gmail.com"
    to: ["recipient@example.com"]
    subject: "üö® HealthCheck Alert: {{.Name}}"
    tls: true
```

### Discord Notifications

```yaml
notifications:
  discord:
    enabled: true
    webhook_url: "${DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL}"
    username: "HealthCheck Bot"
    avatar_url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renancavalcantercb/healthcheck-cli/main/assets/logo.png"
```

### SSL Certificate Monitoring

Monitor SSL certificates for expiration and validity:

```yaml
checks:
  - name: "Production API SSL"
    type: "ssl"
    url: "https://api.production.com"
    interval: 12h                    # Check twice daily
    timeout: 10s
    expected:
      cert_expiry_days: 14          # Alert if expires within 14 days
      cert_valid_domains:           # Verify certificate covers these domains
        - "api.production.com"
        - "www.api.production.com"
      response_time_max: 3s         # Alert if SSL handshake is slow
    tags: ["ssl", "production", "critical"]

  # Alternative host:port format
  - name: "Database SSL"
    type: "ssl"
    url: "db.internal.com:5432"
    interval: 24h
    timeout: 5s
    expected:
      cert_expiry_days: 30
      cert_valid_domains: ["db.internal.com"]
      response_time_max: 2s
    tags: ["ssl", "database"]
```

**SSL Check Features:**
- **Certificate expiration monitoring** - Get alerts before certificates expire
- **Domain validation** - Ensure certificates cover expected domains (CN + SAN)
- **SSL handshake performance** - Monitor connection establishment time
- **Detailed certificate info** - Subject, issuer, expiry date, and valid domains
- **Flexible URL formats** - Support both `https://domain.com` and `domain.com:443`

### Notification Rules

```yaml
notifications:
  global_rules:
    on_success: true
    on_failure: true
    on_recovery: true
    on_slow_response: true
    cooldown: 5m
    max_alerts: 10
    escalation_delay: 15m
```

### Performance Optimization

The tool uses a worker pool to execute health checks in parallel, which significantly improves performance when monitoring multiple endpoints. You can configure the number of concurrent workers in the global settings:

```yaml
global:
  max_workers: 10  # Adjust based on your system's capabilities
```

Key benefits of parallel execution:
- Faster overall execution time
- Better resource utilization
- Configurable concurrency level
- Automatic load balancing
- Graceful error handling

## Usage
